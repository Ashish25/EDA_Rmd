# _White Wine Exploratory Analysis_

* In this project I will conduct our own exploratory data analysis and create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of a data set.
* This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer. The analysis is almost like a stream-of-consciousness as you I questions, create visualizations, and explore the data.

I documented my exploration in following manner-

1. A stream-of-consciousness analysis and exploration of the data (Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate exploration)
2. A section at the end called “Final Plots and Summary”.
3. A final section called “Reflection”.
